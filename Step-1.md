# Clone Project

### Clone the Solution

The first step is to clone the project into a new folder.

```git clone https://github.com/gunjandatta/sprest-bs-starter sp-dashboard```

### Remove Repository Reference

We don't need a reference to the starter project, so we will remove the .git hidden directory.

```rm -r my-project/.git```

### Update Project Name

Update the ```./package.json``` "name" property to the project name. This name will be referenced as the output file for the solution.
