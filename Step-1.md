# Clone Project

### Clone the Solution

The first step is to clone the project into a new folder.

```git clone https://github.com/gunjandatta/sprest-bs-starter sp-dashboard```

### Remove Repository Reference

We don't need a reference to the starter project, so we will remove the .git hidden directory.

```rm -r sp-dashboard/.git```

### Remove Components Directory

We will not be using the "src/components" directory for this solution.

```rm -r sp-dashboard/src/components```
