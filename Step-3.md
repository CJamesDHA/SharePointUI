### [[Previous Step|Step 2]]

# Code Solution

Now that we have created and configured the project, it's time for the fun stuff...the code.

## Source Code

- [[src/strings.ts|Step 4]]
- [[src/cfg.ts|Step 5]] - The configuration file for the project assets.
- [[src/ds.ts|Step 6]] - The methods used to interact with the list data.
- [[src/app.ts|Step 7]] - The code which renders the application.
- [[src/index.ts|Step 8]] - The main source file for the project which brings everything together.

### Static Variables [[src/strings.ts|Step 4]]

The static strings for the application.

### Configuration File [[src/cfg.ts|Step 5]]

The configuration file will contain the logic for adding/removing the custom action.

### Data Source [[src/ds.ts|Step 6]]

We will create a list webpart, and display the list items in a bootstrap table.

### Application [[src/app.ts|Step 7]]

The main file which renders the application.

### Main Source [[src/index.ts|Step 8]]

The main source file will combine all of the project files together, into a global variable.
