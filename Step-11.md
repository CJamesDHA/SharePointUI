# Upgrade to O365

Now we will upgrade the SharePoint 2013 solution to SharePoint Online. We already created the methods for SPFx solutions, so we only need to reference the library.

## Requirements

Reference the [MS Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment) for setting up your environment for SPFx. We will be following the [hello world](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part) example for creating a SPFx webpart.
