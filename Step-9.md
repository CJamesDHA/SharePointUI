# Build the Solution

## Reference TypeScript

We want to reference typescript, since we didn't include it as part of the dependencies for this project. Run ```npm link typescript``` to link in the node_modules folder to typescript.

## Package the Solution

From the terminal, run ```npm run build``` to build the project. The typescript code and dependencies will be bundled into a single javascript file, in the dist folder.
